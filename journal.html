<h3>November 6th, 2025</h3>
<p>This is my third journal entry on the date of November 6th, 2025. Today I worked on writing this journal entry and putting my second project on my website. I also centered my images on the home page. I will continue to work on the background of my project and journal page.</p>

<h3>November 20th, 2025</h3>

<h3>December 4th, 2025</h3>
<p>This is my fifth journal entry on the date of December 4th, 2025. Today I worked on my clicking event listener. It was fun to find a gif that I loved. I decided on the pizza walking. It is hilarious.
